# Week Notes 2024-48

So the weekly Notes journey starts

- still a little tattered from last week
- started working on creating a new qmk keyboard firmware for the void16 case

**Multimedia**

**Buy**

- finally bought a 3D Printer (Bambu Lab P1S) for 550â‚¬ - already thought about it for a long time if i want to buy a kit and build it myself or buy a ready to go one, decided to start with a ready made one and build one later
