# Week Notes 2024-48

So the weekly Notes journey starts

- the week started with me being ill, having scratches in the throat which pushed through the whole week
- we have the company christmas party this week
- polished my card generator - https://github.com/papierkorp/card_generator, which is almost ready now
- my Aifen A9 Solder station was delivered this week, before i used the ERSA 30S but i met certain limits working with it and it wasnt that much fun if its not working
- every day i get to work by bicycle no matter which weather, after being ill for the last 3 days it was like doing 2 hours of sport or driving an insane mountain and i was sweating/breathing like crazy for it being not that hard of a route..

**Multimedia**

- played around 10h of counter strike (faceit) and 2h of reinforcing my util knowledge for ancient/train
- watched the series `Achtsam morden` on netflix, was a mix between slightly funny and cringe for me
- watched the film `Officer Black Belt` which was surprisingly funny for me
- watched the film `Gemini Man` which ended up on the second monitor for me since it was a little boring because predictable
- currently reading `Otherworldly Evil Monarch` at Chapter ~1000 of 1277, a little too much unrealisticaly harem for me again

**Interesting News**

- i learned a about weekly notes and decided to try it for myself
