# Introduction

So I made this file mainly for myself, to open it up on my second Screen while gaming. Primarly to remember the line ups (if I dont use them that often :D). This is to say, there are a whole lot of other options to throw this specific smokes. Also you should try and test the smokes on a offline server before hopping straight into competitive.

I can just recommend using [cs2.app](https://www.cs2.app/) of [Youtube - nartouthere](https://www.youtube.com/@nartouthere), which is updated after each Pro event for the newest and best tipps and tricks.

I dont think I will update this Image any time soon.
